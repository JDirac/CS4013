How to compile and run this program:
	1. Open command prompt and navigate to the source directory using the cd command (example: cd C:\Users\yourName\Downloads\PCMSystem\source)
	2. To compile the program, do: javac PCMSystem.java
	3. Finally, to run the program, do: java PCMSystem

Alternatively, I have left a batch file in this directory that will execute the above commands for you and run the program. The file is called "RunPCMSystem.bat"
